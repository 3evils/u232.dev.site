:: About

The ocelot tracker has a long and storied [past](http://torrentfreak.com/what-cd-debuts-lightweight-tracker-for-its-5-million-peers-101014/).

A friend of mine asked me to take a look at it a while back, and I ended
up making some modifications related to setuid() and IPv6. I posted a patch
to the what.cd developer forums, but received no helpful responses. 

I've kept these changes private for a long time. I'm releasing them now
because it seems like the public-facing what.cd forums have shut down. Every
page seems to display only an "Unexpected error" message (as of 07/24/2012,
but this has been the case for months).

My hope is that people who want to work on ocelot will have an easier time
on github.

:: Todo

- Make worker::work and children threadsafe.
- In connection_middleman::handle_read, use multiple threads to compute responses.
- Investiage if compression would be useful.
- Replace std::map with something more efficient. (According to profiling data, the only function busier than worker::work is std::_Rb_tree::_M_lower_bound, which is used by std::map.)

:: Notes

- Only one announce is possible at a time because db->torrent_list_mutex is locked.

:: License

Ocelot does not ship with a license file. I don't know what the original
developers' wishes were, but the standard disclaimer no doubt applies;
